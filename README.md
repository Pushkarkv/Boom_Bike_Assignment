## General Information
- This assignment is a programming assignment wherein I have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.
- Using the previous two year data to predict the demand.
- BoomBikes two year demand data.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Found 10 features that could help predict the no of bikes.
- Mejority of the features they have collected, even tough they can predict the demand, they can not be contolled.
- They could use the prediction results to ensure availability of bikes so that they are able to maximize on the oppertunity.
- They also should collecct more demogarphic, advertizement, customer behavoiral data so as to have more variable that they can control.
